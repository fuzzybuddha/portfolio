                                <h4>My Role:</h4>
                                <p>I did graphic and UX design for BrainCharmers, spidermapping ideas out with XMind when the project was first getting started and creating characters and sprites while copying the style of a previous artist they had comissioned.  BrainCharmers is a game that Akasha Games Inc. was working on at Boost VC in San Mateo.</p>

                                <h4>Game description:</h4>
                                <p>Brain Charmers teaches computer programming, practical neuroanatomy and evolutionary biology, all while having fun. You are a mad scientist with strange creatures genetically engineered to have re-programmable brains. You can't control them directly, but you can program them to think for themselves and navigate their environment successfully. They start out dumb, but grow more intelligent. Game mechanics, music and graphics all evolve with you. Search for food, find your way through mazes, make alliances, outsmart your masters, even mingle with your friends' creatures. </p>

                                <h4>Spidermaps:</h4>
                                <p>Although I love brainstorming things out on paper, one of the things I love most about XMind is that your spidermaps never run out of space or become too large for paper.  You can always come back to them weeks later too and add things into the middle of them, or resort the structure of the map.  I have found this method to be more efficient than card sorts.</p>
