                                <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                                <p>I was hired to design a new set of marketing and promotion materials for OPERS, the largest department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. This included a 16-page spread, a quarterly activity catalogue, and maps that show where to find all of the department's facilities.</p>
                                <p>UC Santa Cruz OPERS had hundreds of programs, but there was no central overview of what the campus had to offer. It was troublesome for the student body of 17,000 to figure out which subdepartment to register under without phoning the OPERS office directors or showing up in person.</p>
                                <p>I did a presentation of this design in front of a board of 15 supervisors, who helped me consolidate all of the important information, contacts and registration instructions for the hundreds of OPERS activities on campus. It will be in print for at least another 5 years.</p>

                                <h5>Requirements:</h5>
                                <li><strong>Information Consolidation:</strong> OPERS department has several sub-departments whose information needs to be consolidated to one source, in an easily understood way.</li>
                                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> We needed a way to streamline the student registration process for physical education, recreation and sports activities.</li>
                                <li><strong>Interaction Flow:</strong> We want a simple booklet/brochure that could direct students to the appropriate online registration forms and information without all of the textual clutter of detailed information that can be found online</li>
                                <li><strong>Visual Design:</strong> We need a more attractive, sensible and efficient visual design that draws the reader's eye toward key signup information.</li>
                                <li><strong>Maps:</strong> We need maps for campus facilities so that new students know where everything is.</li>
                                <h5>Concerns:</h5>
                                <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Recreation was wasting a lot of money printing out quarterly guides which were often never even picked up or used.</li>
                                <li><strong>Department Confusion:</strong> It was not clear which departments were in charge of which activities, making registration difficult.</li>
                                <li><strong>Registration Confusion:</strong> The current recreation guide just puts everything together and forces the student to call the office or search around online to find the appropriate registration process.</li>

                            <div class="col-xs-12 proj-desc">
                                <h4>User Research</h4>

                                    <p class="half-indent"><strong>I polled fifteen different student groups from the University of California, Santa Cruz to ask what they would like to see changed about the OPERS recreation guide and received many useful responses.</strong><p>
                                    <li>Many students were confused about which departments were in charge of which campus activities and quickly lost interest before being able to figure out how to register.</li>
                                    <li>The current quarterly guide was too text heavy and took too much patience to read through. Students wanted to be able to look class descriptions up individually online instead.</li>
                                    <li>Graphics and photos were small and low resolution.  The experience of OPERS activities was not adequately conveyed.</li>

                                <p><strong>I did a lot of research looking through dozens of other university campus recreation guides, websites, and registration processes.  Some of the best interaction flows and designs I saw included the booklets for University of Houston, Texas and University of California, Los Angeles.  I also did research on their registration processes and marketing materials to see what bigger campuses were doing to organize large numbers of sports clubs, student groups, activities, and subdepartments.</strong></p>

                                <li>I presented my mockups and wireframes to my meeting with the OPERS directors and marketing team and requested feedback from them.</li>
                                <li>I also set up a Dropbox account so that all of the people in the department could watch my progress day by day without needing any check-ins or updates.</li>
                                <li>I also provided an editable google doc for anyone in the department to add suggestions to, as ideas came up for them in my following weeks of work.</li>

                                <li><strong>Registration Confusion:</strong> I found all of the contact information for the individual departments on campus and divided them into program categories with the help of the director of Recreation.  I also added three large button-like squares that contain the program phone number, website, and registration URL at the bottoms of the pages.  These squares draw the eye toward them due to the consistency in their color combination from page to page.</li>
                                <li><strong>Familiarity:</strong> I went through tens of thousands of photographs of OPERS activities and chose ones that portrayed a diverse set of students all enjoying what our programs had to offer.  Extra care was taken to include all demographics of OPERS program participants, including community members, elderly, students and children.</li>
                                <li><strong> and Hierarchical Grouping:</strong> I created novel graphic designs uniquely tailored to each program page, and grouped all visual elements in a hierarchical fashion in order to minimize cognitive load and make it easier for students to scan the pages quickly and figure out if the program was what they were looking for.</li>
